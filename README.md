# Humanoid Image Separator
For personal usage, maybe.


## Usage
```
python -u imageSeparator.py
```

> Tips

- Press 'F' key to save the image dir into a 'file.txt' file on the same dir.
- Press 'J' to skip the images without saving them on the 'file.txt'.
- Press 'B' to see the previous images which you skip by mistake and when you're done just press 'J' again to continue.
